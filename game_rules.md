# Game Name: Budallas

## Game Basics
**What is it?** Budallas is a card game, similar to Russian Durak, but with Balkan characteristics.
**What's the goal?** Get rid of the cards in your hand as quickly as possible. The last player with cards in their hand is the loser (fool/"budala")
**How to play?** It is played with 36 cards of the standard deck, from lowest to highest value: 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A
**Who can play?** There can be 2-5 players in a game

## Game Start
**How to start?** Each player is dealt 6 cards. A card from the bottom of the remaining deck is then placed face up, indicating the "special" suit
**Who starts?** Usually the youngest player starts attacking. The player on their left is the defender
**What are the roles?** In each round there is a defender and the rest are attackers
**What are the different moves?** A defender can defend, pass or take, and the attackers can attack

## Attack and Defense
**Primary Attacker** The attacker plays a card face up on the table
**Primary Defender** To defend, a defender must play a higher card of the same suit or any trump card to defend the card
**What then?** If defender defends, the attacker can choose to continue the attack or let other players attack
**How to attack again?** To attack again there must be a card of the same value on the table
**How to let others attack?** If a player can no longer attack, they pass the turn to the player on their left (skipping the defender)

## Defense Rules
**Rule 1** If the defender defends all of the cards on the table, all cards on the table go to the discard deck
**Rule 2** If there is no discard deck at the moment, the maximum number of attacking card on the table is 5
**Rule 3** If there is a discard deck, the maximum number of attacking card on the table is 6
**Rule 4** Keep in mind that you can't attack a player with more cards than what he holds in hand (if he has 2 cards, the max is 2)
**Rule 5** If a defender can't defend the cards on the table, they have to pick every card on the table up

## Passing Rules
**Rule 1** A defender can pass the cards he is being attacked with if he hasn't defended any cards yet
**Rule 2** A defender can pass only if the cards they are being attacked with are the same rank as the card they want to pass on
**Rule 3** Since a pass would go to the defender's left, it is only allowed if the player on their left has enough cards to defend the pass

## End of Round
**When does the round end?** It ends when all players had a chance to attack or the maximum number of attacks was reached
**What if defender succeeded?** All cards on the table will be discarded and they will be the first to attack in the next round
**What if defender failed?** They must take all the cards from the table and lose the turn to attack in the next round
**What then?** At the end of the round, all players must draw from the deck in order until they have 6 cards again
**What is the drawing order?** First it's the defender, then the attacker and then everybody else in order of attack

## End of the Game
**What happens when the deck is gone?** We reach the endgame. No more drawing cards from the deck at the end of the round
**How to win?** There is no 1 winner, as long as you aren't the last one to get rid of your cards, you win
**How to lose?** The last player with cards in their hands is the fool or "budala"
