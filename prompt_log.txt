I had 3 seperate chats for this Homework and I used Gemini Pro model to complete the initial stages of the project.

ARCHITECT CHAT:
i pushed it and the deploy was succesful. but this link https://budallas-backend.onrender.com still doesnt work. it says: Not Found The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.

is this how server.py should look:

the previous version was 260 lines, this si 200 lines, why is that

add the reconnection/disconnect

so if i just push this change in the server.py, the render linnk will work after the deploy? or should i change other files as well?

did you mean a js file like this:

now it works, but when me and my friend joined we were both sent to the waiting room and the screen just said: Waiting Room Room: room2 Players Present Waiting for opponents... and nothing happened for 2 minutes. what should i change in the code

we both put in "room2"

i changed the procfile, but could i also make it so it displays who is in the waiting room when i waiting. the player names

are you sure nothing else needs to be changed before i push and wait for deploy? be critical here

Waiting Room Room: room4 Players Present Waiting for opponents... same issue is it because the 50s delay? or becuase i launch the web app right after the deploy is finished

these are already commited and pushed. so it must be something wrong with these

The version that is ucrrently on is wokring but needs improvements. i dont want to improve it right now, i would rather first understand how it all works together and then go impoving. can you write a prompt for another chat that i will use in which you say that all of this in the project need to be explained

this is how this project must be submitted: What You Must Submit Backend code deployment: A public Render deployment link to your running backend service. (Note: If you wish to use a different service like Vercel, that's ok too, though we will be best equipped to help you with Render.) Backend code on GitHub: A new public repository containing your backend code (Python using Flask or FastAPI is recommended) along with your readme and prompt log described below. Note that this repository is different from the repository you will use for your frontent.README: In your backend repo, add a README that briefly explains:What your backend does (what endpoints it has, what parameters it accepts, what it returns) How the frontend communicates with the backend (which endpoints it calls, when, and what it does with the response) How to set up and run the backend (including any environment variables or API keys needed locally) How authentication or secrets are handled (e.g., API keys stored on the backend, not in frontend code) Prompt log: In your backend repo, add a short note (in README or PROMPT_HISTORY.txt) listing which AI model(s)/tool(s) you used and the key prompts that shaped implementation. Frontend code deployed and on GitHub: Add your frontend code to Github pages (either as a new feature on your portfolio or as a separate page, like the Carnegie Chat example). This is the HTML/CSS/JavaScript that communicates with your backend. Portfolio: If your work is not a feature on your portfolio (i.e. if it's not already directly integrated into your portfolio somehow) add a link to it in your projects section. Short Video: Make a short video that shows what you've created and how it works (screenshare of the frontend interacting with the backend is fine). This can be brief, but should contain enough information for us to grade your work if we can't run it ourselves. Submit a link to the video (YouTube or Google Drive with view permissions) below. Google form: As before, we'll release a form that asks for some key information, like the public URL for your frontend (which might just be a link to your portfolio), the repository URL for your backend, the repository URL for your frontend, and the link to your video. Be sure to fill this out before the deadline. Privacy and Security: Once again, do not commit API keys, credentials, or secrets to GitHub. Keep all secrets on the Render backend using environment variables or an uploaded secret file that is not in your repository. We will not accept submissions that expose private keys publicly. Watch the tutorial video for information on how to do this.  i currently have 1 repo with everything in it

will the game still work as it is right now? do i risk game speed or any game qualities by making the website static?

is this server.py code fine?

it does say Budallas Backend is Running! how do i set up the frontend now?

it works. now does this follow the assignment requirements?

give me a couple of most crucial prompts i gave you in this chat, so that i can put them in the prompt log. copy the exact prompt i gave you

i also found an issue in the game as it is currently presented. When two people play. the only problem is the "Somebody is attacking" text is getting messed up by the cards placed on the table. the who is attacking message should be displayed somewhere where it will be seen at all times, not block the game and not ruin the aesthetic of the web app. the second issue is when more than 2 people play. if the attacker wants to finish the attack, they press the done button, and done allows other pplayers to also attack the defender. but what happens is that the done button just keeps passing between other players and the attacker. we never get to the discard deck stage. it is always just passing the role of the attacker. how do we fix this issue?

is this now a good css:

is this how the game.py file should look like?

give me all of the prompts i have given you so far. dont sumarize them or make them shorter. i expect a list of all the prompts that i have given you in this chat. dont put the code i just copied and pasted in here. all of the wording prompts i have given you


FRONTEND CHAT

I have a Flask-SocketIO server running the 'Budallas' card game. The server sends a JSON state object that looks like this: { 'hand': [...], 'table_attack': [...], 'table_defense': [...] } Help me write the index.html, style.css and client.js to render the game board and handle clicking cards to attack/defend. make it look modern and professional

where in this code does it connect to the render.com backend?

i have css and js files inside a folder next to html file. should all three be on the same level?

this is better. i want it to take me to a waiting room once i join game, only when there are more than 2 players, is there a start game button, which will start the game. also i want the background to have a Slavic design, some imperal russian or traditional eastern european, whatever is easier and looks better, try making these changes and get back to me with all three files

i like the waiting room change, I dont like the slavic design, i was wrong about it. make it inspired by nature, mountains. make it look impressive. make that the background. the join game and waiting room can be just plain simple modern looking, but i want an ambient for the backgounrd, something beautiful

this is better. can the trump card be displayed in the upper left corner, the actual card, not just mini rank and suit. i also want it to say in the upper middle, who is attacker and who is defender. i would also like a yellow outline for the cards when hoggled over.

i have this kind of repo structure: a static folder in which are js and css folders in which are client.js and style.css files. and next to static folder is the template folder in which is index.html file. i am concerned the html never gets the style and client files, because of the file path: ... could you fix this

are you sure html file can reach the static/js.client.js because it is in the template folder, my question is if it is able to see the static folder

give me a couple of most crucial prompts i gave you in this chat, so that i can put them in the prompt log. copy the exact prompt i gave you

this is the current frontend i want the background be the image i gave you. and i want the rest fo the frontend to match that background image in that style. i also want to move the restart button on the bottom right of the screen, instead of next to the other buttons. i want the game buttons to all be different colours.

i want you only to tell me what to change in the files i have given you.

i dont like the way you removed a lot of my code. just tell me how to make the background be the image i gave you

i dont want the mountain image, i want the jpg i save in my folder

this is my css, but it displays a nothing background when i run it. my css is in the css folder and my jpg is in the images folder. how should i change this so my css can see the backrground image

i got it. but the image seems a bit too dark for the background. how can i make it more ligther, more light in the background with the same image

BACKEND CHAT
I have the finalized game.py logic for my card game 'Budallas'. It includes the Game, Player, Deck, and Card classes and is fully tested.
Goal: I want to build a Flask + Flask-SocketIO backend to host this game.
Requirements:
2-5 players are allowed to connect to a game room.
Store the Game instance on the server so state is preserved.
Create SocketIO event listeners for connect, attack, defend, pass, and skip that call my Game methods.
Handle sending updates back to the frontend (e.g., hiding opponent cards).
Here is my game.py code

how does this app.py fit in the whole project scheme? should it be in the same github repo as game.py? should i just upload it on render/ should i sign up to socket.io? is it atuomatically on Render, or should i sign up to host the backend there for free

but you gave me just the app.py? in my repository for the game, currently are the game rules text file and the game.py

okay, i added the required files and pushed it to my repo. before i do the html, css and js, could you simply explain how to get it up on Render

doe sthis mean its live? and is everything working well? i need to konw before i go to hmtl, css, js

i duplicated the window, but it did not let me start the game. and i also think the forntend isnt connecting to the backend. this is the html code:
[...code...]
this is the backend render terminal:
[...logs...]
doe sthis mean its live? and is everything working well? i need to konw before i go to hmtl, css, js

im in safari, how to i inspect page?

i opened the console, but its empty, i dont see anything there

it says this: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
in the console

this is what happened when i clicked on the error: Cannot GET /favicon.ico

its true

it really works. i will come back to this chat, in case something goes wrong with the backend. otherwise, i will focus on the frontend now. could you just tell me how to log what requests are going to the backend?

a button to take a card wasnt working before. now i fixed it in game.py with the action_take method. could you change up the current app.py file or the html so that the game will have the feature where the defender can just give up and take all the cards on the table

so i tried it. the take button is there, but when an attacker attacked the defender, the defender clicked the button multiple times, but the card wasnt taken. its like the button does nothing

how to see deployments and actions on render

Deploy failed for b754ad3: made structure for frontend
Exited with status 1 while running your code. Check your deploy logs for more information.

my deploy failed, what shoudl i do

give me a couple of most crucial prompts i gave you in this chat, so that i can put them in the prompt log. copy the exact prompt i gave you

this is currently the backend. can you fix the game rules. currently, a defender can defend with all the cards he has and still be attacked with with another one, despite not having any cards in his hand.

any other errors you see present here? could you also add abutton to restart the game. or should i make that in the frontend?

if this is the html, what should i edit to make it work:

is this js okay:

give me the whole js and html with these fixes. also when the game finishes, i want it to say who lost as it is now, but also to show the option to restart the game
